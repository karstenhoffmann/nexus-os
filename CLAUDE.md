# Nexus OS - Project Constitution

## 1. Governance (Rules of the House)
- **Librarian Protocol:** Never append. MERGE info into existing docs.
- **Teacher Protocol:** If the user is a beginner, explain "Why" before "How."
- **Clean Room:** Run `/janitor` after every major task completion.

## 2. Directory Mapping (The Source of Truth)
- Product Vision & Phases: @.claude/docs/product_brief.md
- Technical Specs & Rules: @.claude/docs/architecture.md
- Work-in-Progress Ideas: @.claude/docs/whiteboard.md
- Active Task & Progress: @.claude/records/MISSION_CONTROL.md
- Decision History: @.claude/records/DECISION_LOG.md

## 3. Tech Stack Constraints
- Python 3.14 + FastAPI + HTMX + Alpine.js.
- NO Node.js. Use SQLite-vec for semantic search.
