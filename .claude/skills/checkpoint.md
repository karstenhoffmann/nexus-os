# Skill: Checkpoint & Prep Commit
**Goal:** Stage work, save context, and prepare the final Git command.

**Procedure:**
1. **Auto-Stage:** Run `git add .`.
2. **Draft Message:** Analyze the diff and write a "Draft Commit Message" in conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: ...` or `fix: ...`).
3. **Mental Thread:** Update the `## ⏸️ PAUSED SESSION` in MISSION_CONTROL.md.
4. **The Handover:** Output a code block with the exact `git commit` and `git push` commands for the user to copy/paste or approve.
